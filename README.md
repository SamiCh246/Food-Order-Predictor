# FoodX Order Prediction - Xtern AI Work Assessment

This repository contains the solution for the Xtern AI Work Assessment related to predicting customer orders for FoodX.

## Introduction

The primary objective of this assessment is to automate order prediction for FoodX customers to enhance customer satisfaction and reduce the workload on staff. We aim to build a machine learning model to predict orders based on the provided dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted EDA to understand the distribution and biases in the data.
- Visualized feature distributions and interactions with the target variable.
- Provided insights into the data's patterns and correlations.

## Implications

### Ethical Implications

- Considered ethical implications related to data collection and usage, ensuring data respects privacy and obtains necessary consents.

### Business Outcome Implications

- Assessed the potential business benefits of order prediction, such as reduced staff workload and improved customer experience.

### Technical Implications

- Discussed the technical aspects of model integration, scalability, and data security.

## Model Building

- Utilized scikit-learn to build machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine models.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Model Evaluation

- Evaluated model performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Provided classification reports for model assessment.

## Considerations

Considerations for the deployment and maintenance of the solution, including model updates, data security, scalability, and model explainability.
